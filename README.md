This year I'm doing C# because I looked at the job market and saw that C# is very prevalent, and I am a bit rusty with it.

I'm probably going to be skipping problems that seem unpleasant for me, such as typical AoC problems which involve a lot of 2D/3D grid manipulation, because they are very simple to come up with, but very fiddly and time consuming to implement.
